This unit translates derivative ideas into real-world language. The math is usually not harder than earlier differentiation, but the interpretation must be precise.

## Rates of change in context

If $$Q(t)$$ is a quantity depending on time, then:

- $$Q'(t)$$ is the instantaneous rate of change of $$Q$$,
- units of $$Q'(t)$$ are units of $$Q$$ per unit of $$t$$.

Always interpret both sign and units.

---

## Average vs instantaneous rate

Average rate on $$[a,b]$$:

$$
\frac{Q(b)-Q(a)}{b-a}
$$

Instantaneous rate at $$t=a$$:

$$
Q'(a).
$$

## Position, velocity, acceleration

If position is $$s(t)$$, then

$$
v(t) = s'(t), \qquad a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t).
$$

Interpret carefully:

- $$v(t) > 0$$ means motion in the positive direction,
- $$v(t) < 0$$ means motion in the negative direction,
- speed is $$\lvert v(t) \rvert$$.

Speed increasing:

- $$v(t) > 0$$ and $$a(t) > 0$$, or
- $$v(t) < 0$$ and $$a(t) < 0$$.

<div class="theorem-box">

**Why same signs mean speed increases.** Speed is $$|v(t)|$$, so it measures how far velocity is from $$0$$. If $$v>0$$ and $$a=v'>0$$, then velocity is positive and getting larger, so $$|v|$$ increases. If $$v<0$$ and $$a<0$$, then velocity is negative and becoming more negative, so it is moving farther from $$0$$, and $$|v|$$ also increases.

When velocity and acceleration have opposite signs, velocity moves closer to $$0$$, so speed decreases.

</div>

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** A particle moves along a line with position $$s(t)=t^3-6t^2+9t$$ meters, where $$t$$ is in seconds. Find the velocity and acceleration at $$t=4$$, and determine whether the particle is speeding up or slowing down.

Differentiate to get velocity and acceleration:

$$
v(t)=s'(t)=3t^2-12t+9,\qquad a(t)=v'(t)=6t-12.
$$

Evaluate both at $$t=4$$:

$$
v(4)=3(16)-12(4)+9=48-48+9=9\ \text{m/s},
$$

$$
a(4)=6(4)-12=12\ \text{m/s}^2.
$$

At $$t=4$$ the velocity is $$+9$$ m/s and the acceleration is $$+12$$ m/s$$^2$$. Because velocity and acceleration have the same sign, the velocity is moving farther from zero, so the particle is speeding up.

</div>

## Rate in, rate out, and accumulation

If a quantity changes because something enters and leaves, then:

$$
\text{net change rate} = \text{rate in} - \text{rate out}.
$$

If $$R(t)$$ is the rate entering a tank and $$L(t)$$ is the rate leaving, then:

$$
V'(t) = R(t) - L(t).
$$

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** Water enters a tank at a constant rate $$R(t)=8$$ gallons per minute, and leaves at a rate $$L(t)=t$$ gallons per minute, where $$t$$ is in minutes. Find $$V'(10)$$ and state whether the volume is rising or falling at that instant.

The net rate of change of volume is the rate in minus the rate out:

$$
V'(t)=R(t)-L(t)=8-t.
$$

Evaluate at $$t=10$$:

$$
V'(10)=8-10=-2\ \text{gallons per minute}.
$$

At $$t=10$$ minutes the volume is changing at $$-2$$ gallons per minute. The negative sign means more water is leaving than entering, so the volume is falling at that instant.

</div>

## Interpreting graphs in context

Given a graph of a function:

- slope tells rate of change,
- steep positive slope means rapid increase,
- slope near zero means little short-term change,
- concavity tells whether the rate itself is increasing or decreasing.

Given a graph of a derivative:

- positive derivative means original function is increasing,
- negative derivative means decreasing,
- derivative crossing zero may indicate an extremum in the original function.

## Related rates in context

Related rates problems are mostly about translation. The key source equations usually come from:

- Pythagorean theorem,
- volume formulas,
- area formulas,
- similar triangles.

If the problem asks how fast a quantity is changing, the final answer should usually be a value of a derivative with units.

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** Air is pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume increases at $$\frac{dV}{dt}=100$$ cubic centimeters per second. How fast is the radius changing at the moment when $$r=5$$ cm?

The source equation is the volume of a sphere:

$$
V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3.
$$

Differentiate both sides with respect to time, treating $$r$$ as a function of $$t$$:

$$
\frac{dV}{dt}=4\pi r^2\,\frac{dr}{dt}.
$$

Substitute the known values $$\frac{dV}{dt}=100$$ and $$r=5$$:

$$
100=4\pi(5)^2\,\frac{dr}{dt}=100\pi\,\frac{dr}{dt}.
$$

Solve for the radius rate:

$$
\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{100}{100\pi}=\frac{1}{\pi}\approx 0.318\ \text{cm/s}.
$$

When the radius is $$5$$ cm, it is increasing at about $$0.318$$ centimeters per second. The rate is positive because the balloon is inflating.

</div>

## Linearization and differentials

Near $$x=a$$,

$$
L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)
$$

approximates $$f(x)$$.

Differentials use the same idea:

$$
dy = f'(x)\,dx.
$$

If a measured input has small error $$dx$$, then the output error is approximately $$dy$$.

<div class="theorem-box">

**Why linearization works.** Differentiability at $$a$$ means

$$
f'(a)=\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}.
$$

For $$x$$ close to $$a$$, the difference quotient is close to $$f'(a)$$, so

$$
\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}\approx f'(a).
$$

Multiplying by $$x-a$$ gives

$$
f(x)\approx f(a)+f'(a)(x-a).
$$

</div>

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** Use a linearization to estimate $$\sqrt{27}$$.

Let $$f(x)=\sqrt{x}$$ and choose the nearby easy point $$a=25$$, since $$\sqrt{25}=5$$. The derivative is

$$
f'(x)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}},\qquad f'(25)=\frac{1}{2\cdot 5}=\frac{1}{10}.
$$

The linearization at $$a=25$$ is

$$
L(x)=f(25)+f'(25)(x-25)=5+\frac{1}{10}(x-25).
$$

Estimate at $$x=27$$:

$$
\sqrt{27}\approx L(27)=5+\frac{1}{10}(2)=5.2.
$$

So $$\sqrt{27}\approx 5.2$$. The true value is about $$5.196$$, so the linear estimate is accurate to within a couple thousandths because $$27$$ is close to $$25$$.

</div>

## Marginal analysis

In economics-flavored problems:

- cost function $$C(x)$$,
- revenue function $$R(x)$$,
- profit $$P(x) = R(x)-C(x)$$.

Then:

- marginal cost is $$C'(x)$$,
- marginal revenue is $$R'(x)$$,
- marginal profit is $$P'(x)$$.

At large production levels, these are interpreted as approximate change from one additional unit.

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** The cost of producing $$x$$ items is $$C(x)=0.01x^2+5x+500$$ dollars. Find the marginal cost at a production level of $$x=100$$ items and interpret it.

Marginal cost is the derivative of the cost function:

$$
C'(x)=0.02x+5.
$$

Evaluate at $$x=100$$:

$$
C'(100)=0.02(100)+5=2+5=7\ \text{dollars per item}.
$$

The marginal cost at $$100$$ items is $$7$$ dollars per item. This means that when production is at $$100$$ items, producing approximately one additional item costs about $$7$$ dollars.

</div>

## Common contextual verbs

- increasing means derivative positive,
- decreasing means derivative negative,
- at what rate means derivative value,
- how fast often means magnitude, but read carefully,
- changing more rapidly compares derivative magnitudes or second derivatives depending on context.

## Reading derivative statements in words

A derivative value is not just a number. A complete interpretation usually needs:

- the quantity changing,
- the input value or time,
- the direction of change if the sign matters,
- correct units.

If $$H(t)$$ is height in meters and $$H'(3)=-2$$, then at $$t=3$$ the height is decreasing at $$2$$ meters per unit of time. The negative sign means the height is going down; the magnitude $$2$$ describes the speed of that change.

<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** Let $$P(t)$$ be the number of fish in a lake, where $$t$$ is measured in years. Write a full sentence interpreting the statement $$P'(5)=40$$.

The quantity changing is the fish population, measured in fish; the input is time in years; the sign is positive, so the population is growing; and the units of the derivative are fish per year. A complete interpretation is:

At time $$t=5$$ years, the fish population is increasing at a rate of $$40$$ fish per year.

Notice that this is a rate, not a total: it does not say there are $$40$$ fish, but rather that the population is growing by about $$40$$ fish for each additional year near $$t=5$$.

</div>

<div class="theorem-box">

**AP language.** "At time $$t=a$$, the quantity is changing at a rate of ..." is usually safer than saying only "the derivative is ..."

</div>

## Derivatives of units

Units help you check whether your answer makes sense.

If a function measures gallons and the input is minutes, the derivative measures gallons per minute. If that derivative is integrated over minutes, the result returns to gallons.

This creates a useful loop:

$$
\text{quantity}
\xrightarrow{\text{differentiate}}
\text{rate}
\xrightarrow{\text{integrate}}
\text{change in quantity}.
$$

When a problem involves a rate in and a rate out, the sign of the net rate tells whether the total amount is increasing or decreasing.

---

## Motion interpretation

For motion on a line, position, velocity, acceleration, and speed are related but not interchangeable.

Velocity:

$$
v(t)=s'(t)
$$

includes direction. Speed:

$$
|v(t)|
$$

does not include direction.

Acceleration:

$$
a(t)=v'(t)
$$

tells how velocity is changing. Speed increases when velocity and acceleration point in the same direction, because the velocity value is moving farther from zero. Speed decreases when velocity and acceleration have opposite signs.

---

## Linearization in context

Linearization is an estimate of output near a known input:

$$
f(a+\Delta x)\approx f(a)+f'(a)\Delta x.
$$

In context, this means a small input change produces an approximate output change:

$$
\Delta f\approx f'(a)\Delta x.
$$

This is the same idea behind differentials:

$$
dy=f'(x)\,dx.
$$

The approximation is local. It is meant for small changes near the input where the derivative was measured.

---

## Related quantities and hidden variables

Contextual problems often include more variables than you actually need. The goal is to write one equation connecting the changing quantities, then identify which rate the question asks for.

Useful habits:

- define every variable before differentiating,
- record which variables are changing,
- keep constants as constants,
- substitute numerical values after differentiating.

If the independent variable is time, every changing quantity gets a rate such as $$dx/dt$$, $$dV/dt$$, or $$dA/dt$$.

---

## Justifying answers from graphs

When using a graph of $$f$$, slope describes $$f'$$. When using a graph of $$f'$$, height describes the rate of change of $$f$$.

That distinction is one of the biggest AP traps:

- graph of position: slope is velocity;
- graph of velocity: height is velocity and slope is acceleration;
- graph of acceleration: height is acceleration.

Always identify what the graph represents before interpreting signs, slopes, or areas.

## Common mistakes

- Reporting velocity when the question asks for speed.
- Giving a derivative without units.
- Using the wrong variable as the independent variable.
- Forgetting to evaluate at the specified time or input.
