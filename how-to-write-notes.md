# How to write notes

The style guide for note pages. `AGENTS.md` treats this file as the source of
truth for note structure and formatting.

Notes now live in `astro/src/content/docs/notes/**/*.md` and render with
**Astro + Starlight**, using **remark-math + rehype-katex** (KaTeX, not MathJax).
A linter — [`astro/scripts/check_notes.py`](astro/scripts/check_notes.py) — checks
the mechanical rules below and runs on every commit and push (see
[Automated checks](#automated-checks)).

> Migrated from Jekyll: there is **no** `# Page title` H1 in the body (Starlight
> uses the front-matter `title`), theorem boxes drop `markdown="1"`, images use
> plain `/assets/...` paths (no `relative_url`), and math is KaTeX.

## Basic format

Every notes page follows this basic format:

``` markdown
---
title: "Page title"
sidebar:
  order: 1            # position within its sidebar group (optional: label, prev, next)
---

---

## Header 1

content content content

### Sub-header 1

//image example
<img class="note-img note-img--w480" src="/assets/image/path/in/repo.png" alt="Free body diagram placeholder" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />

//link example
[link](/notes/category/page/)  //link to another page by its route

### Sub-header 2

<div class="theorem-box">

proof/example here (refer to section below for guidance)

</div>

---

## Header 2

...

---

## Practice

1. question
2. question

...

---

## Solutions

<div class="theorem-box">

### Solution 1

solution here

</div>

...

```

The page title comes from the front-matter `title` — don't add a separate `#`
heading in the body. Start sections at `##`.

---

## Math

**Always use `$$…$$`** for math — both display and inline. Never single `$…$`
(remark-math renders it, but we keep one convention; the linter treats a lone `$`
as an error).

- **Display math** — `$$ … $$` on its own lines.
- **Inline math** — `$$x$$` inside text.

Keep these balanced or the page silently breaks: `$$` delimiters, `{ }`,
`\left`/`\right`, and `\begin{env}`/`\end{env}`. Use `$$…$$`, never LaTeX's
`\( … \)` or `\[ … \]` (remark-math won't render those).

---

## Theorem boxes

The opening tag is exactly `<div class="theorem-box">` — **no** `markdown="1"`.
Always leave a blank line right after the opening tag and right before `</div>`,
and make sure every box is closed.

### Proofs

When writing proofs, always follow this format:

``` markdown
<div class="theorem-box">

**Proof (What identity/formula you are proving).** Proof statement

</div>
```

NEVER box the final identity!

### Examples

When writing examples, always follow this format:

``` markdown
<div class="theorem-box">

**Example.** question statement

solution here

</div>
```

When writing the question statement, always end with what you are trying to find/derive, and don't just state the needed information. For example, say *"A is the 1st letter of the alphabet and C is 2 letters after A. Find the position of letter C."* instead of *"A is the 1st letter of the alphabet and C is 2 letters after A."* and going straight to the answer.

Note that for examples, you NEVER state the main theme of the example. This is done because usually the main idea is already given in the problem and thus will be redundant.

### Theorems

idk I might do this I might not

### Practice solutions

When writing solutions, always follow this format:

``` markdown
<div class="theorem-box">

### Solution number

solution here

$$
\boxed{answer(s) here}.
$$

</div>
```

## Formatting tips

- Always remember to add text BEFORE numbers/formulas to start off bullet points, since if you don't do that the text will automatically pop up in the middle. An example is below:

``` markdown
- $$R=8.314 \frac{J}{\circ K}$$
// WRONG!!!
- Ideal gas constant: $$R=8.314 \frac{J}{\circ K}$$
// CORRECT!
```

- Make sure to always use `\lvert` and `\rvert` instead of vertical bars when doing absolute value, because the renderer sometimes reads vertical bars as a table and messes up the formatting. (Use `\left|`/`\right|` for tall bars and `\mid` for "such that"/conditional probability.)
- Always remember to have proper spacing in between sections! Always make sure to leave a blank space above and below any separation markers, special headers, theorem boxes, and image links.

## Automated checks

The linter enforces the mechanical rules above on the notes you touch:

``` sh
# from the repo root
python3 astro/scripts/check_notes.py                 # all notes
python3 astro/scripts/check_notes.py path/to/note.md # specific files
python3 astro/scripts/check_notes.py --strict        # warnings fail too
python3 astro/scripts/check_notes.py --quiet         # errors only

# or, from astro/
npm run check:notes
```

**Errors** — single `$` math (use `$$`), unclosed `$$`, unbalanced `{ }` /
`\left`-`\right` / `\begin`-`\end`, unbalanced `<div>`, missing front matter or
`title` — block commits and pushes.
**Warnings** — bare `|` in math, missing blank lines around boxes, `markdown="1"`
or `relative_url` leftovers — are reported but don't block (use `--strict` to fail on them).

Install the git hooks once so this runs automatically on commit and push:

``` sh
sh scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

To exempt a generated or special file, put this anywhere in it:

``` markdown
<!-- check-notes: disable -->
```
