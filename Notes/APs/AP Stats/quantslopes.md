# Unit 9: Inference for Quantitative Data: Slopes

This unit extends linear regression from [Unit 2]({{ '/notes/ap/stats/bivardata/' | relative_url }}) into inference. Instead of only describing the least-squares line for a sample, we ask whether there is evidence of a linear relationship in the population.

## Population Regression Model

:::theorem{name="Population regression model"}
For a population, the linear regression model is

$$
Y = \alpha + \beta x + \epsilon.
$$

Here:

- $$\alpha$$ is the population intercept.
- $$\beta$$ is the population slope.
- $$\epsilon$$ is random error around the line.
:::

The sample least-squares line is

$$
\hat{y} = a + bx,
$$

where $$b$$ estimates the true slope $$\beta$$.

The parameter of interest in AP Statistics is usually $$\beta$$, the true slope of the population regression line.

## Conditions For Regression Inference

Use the acronym **LINER**:

:::conditions
1. **Linear**: scatterplot and residual plot show an approximately linear relationship.
2. **Independent**: observations are independent; if sampling without replacement, check the 10% Condition.
3. **Normal**: residuals are approximately normally distributed for each value of $$x$$.
4. **Equal variance**: vertical spread of residuals is roughly constant across $$x$$.
5. **Random**: data come from a random sample or randomized experiment.

## Standard Error Of The Slope

The standard error of the slope is written $$SE_b$$. Technology usually reports it directly.

Conceptually, $$SE_b$$ measures how much the sample slope $$b$$ would vary from sample to sample. Smaller residual scatter and more spread in the explanatory variable make the slope estimate more precise.

:::key{name="Residual standard deviation"}
The residual standard deviation is often written $$s$$:

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2}{n-2}}.
$$
:::

:::key{name="Degrees of freedom"}
The degrees of freedom for regression inference are

$$
df = n-2.
$$

## Confidence Interval For Slope

:::theorem{name="Confidence interval for slope"}
A confidence interval for the true slope $$\beta$$ is

$$
b \pm t^*SE_b.
$$

Use

$$
df=n-2.
$$
:::

:::note
Interpretation: "We are ___% confident that the true slope of the population regression line relating [x-context] to [y-context] is between ___ and ___ [y-units per x-unit]."

If the interval contains 0, then 0 is a plausible true slope at that confidence level. If it does not contain 0, there is evidence of a linear relationship.
:::

---

## t-Test For Slope

:::theorem{name="t-test for slope"}
The usual hypotheses are

$$
H_0:\beta=0
$$

and one of

$$
H_a:\beta>0,\qquad H_a:\beta<0,\qquad H_a:\beta\ne0.
$$

The test statistic is

$$
t = \frac{b-0}{SE_b},
$$

with

$$
df=n-2.
$$
:::

A small p-value gives evidence that the true slope is not 0 in the direction of the alternative.

## Interpreting Regression Output

Technology output often includes:

- Coefficient estimate for intercept $$a$$.
- Coefficient estimate for slope $$b$$.
- Standard error of slope $$SE_b$$.
- t statistic for slope.
- p-value for slope.
- $$s$$, the standard deviation of residuals.
- $$R^2$$, the percent of variability in $$y$$ explained by the linear relationship with $$x$$.

:::warning
Remember: $$R^2$$ is descriptive, while the p-value for slope is inferential. A small p-value does not prove causation, especially with observational data.

## Residual Plots And Diagnostics

:::tip
Before inference, check:

- Scatterplot of $$y$$ versus $$x$$ for form and outliers.
- Residual plot for randomness around 0.
- Residual plot for equal spread.
- Normal probability plot or histogram of residuals for approximate normality.
:::

:::warning
Curvature suggests the linear model is wrong. Fanning suggests unequal variance. Outliers or high-leverage points can strongly affect the slope and p-value.
:::

## Calculator Notes

:::tip
Common calculator tool:

- `LinRegTTest`: tests slope and gives regression output.

Many calculators also provide `LinRegTInt` or interval output depending on model/software. If not, compute

$$
b \pm t^*SE_b
$$

from the regression output.
:::

---

:::checklist
1. Identify the explanatory variable $$x$$ and response variable $$y$$.
2. State the parameter $$\beta$$ in context.
3. Check LINER conditions using plots and study design.
4. Use $$df=n-2$$.
5. Compute the confidence interval or t-test for slope.
6. Interpret slope in units of $$y$$ per one unit of $$x$$.
7. Avoid causal language unless the data come from a randomized experiment.
